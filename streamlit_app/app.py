Welcome to the **Financial Health Calculator**, a comprehensive retirement planning toolkit.

This application helps you:
- **Calculate your CEFR** (Certainty-Equivalent Funded Ratio) - understand how well-funded your retirement is
- **Run Monte Carlo simulations** - see the range of possible outcomes
- **Compare withdrawal strategies** - find the approach that works best for you
- **Analyze sensitivity** - understand which factors matter most

## Getting Started

Use the sidebar to navigate between pages:

1. **📝 Inputs** - Enter your assets, spending, and assumptions
2. **📊 CEFR Dashboard** - See your fundedness ratio and breakdown
3. **📈 Time Runway** - View Monte Carlo projections
4. **💰 Withdrawal Lab** - Compare withdrawal strategies
5. **🎯 Sensitivity** - Understand key risk factors

## Quick Overview

## Key Concepts

### CEFR (Certainty-Equivalent Funded Ratio)

CEFR measures how well-funded your retirement is after accounting for:
- **Taxes** - What you'll owe when withdrawing from different accounts
- **Liquidity** - How easily you can access your assets
- **Reliability** - Risk from concentrated positions

**CEFR ≥ 1.0** means your assets can cover your planned spending.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

Instead of assuming fixed returns, we simulate thousands of possible market scenarios to show:
- The range of possible outcomes (P10, P50, P90)
- Probability of running out of money
- Probability of falling below essential spending

### Withdrawal Strategies

Different approaches to deciding how much to spend each year:
- **Fixed SWR** - Traditional 4% rule
- **Guardrails** - Adjust spending based on portfolio performance
- **VPW** - Variable percentage based on age
- **RMD-Style** - Following IRS distribution tables
